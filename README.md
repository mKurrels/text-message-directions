I have a dumb phone, So I can't use the gps on a smart phone. I made this to send myself text message directions.
You can use it for free.

All you do is text 1 312 313 1234 for directions in the form of <from> " to " <to>

For example, you can text "from uc berkeley to oakland airport".

This project costs money every time I send a text. If you'd like to help the project keep running, feel free to donate here:
